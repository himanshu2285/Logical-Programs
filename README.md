This repository contains a collection of fundamental logical programs written in Java. These programs focus on developing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills â€” perfect for practice, interviews, or academic use.

*ðŸ§  What's Included*
Each program is implemented with clean logic and focuses on core programming concepts such as:

Number-based logic (e.g., Fibonacci series, Prime numbers)

Pattern printing

Palindrome checks

Sorting and searching logic

Recursion-based logic

Basic string manipulations

ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each file is self-contained and named according to its functionality for easy navigation and execution.

ðŸ’¡ Usage
You can clone this repository and run the programs using any Java IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or through the command line:


git clone https://github.com/himanshu2285/Logical-Programs.git
ðŸš€ Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:

Practice and improve logic-building skills

Help with interview preparation

Serve as a quick reference for Java logic-based programs
